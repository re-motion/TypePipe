Getting re-motion
-----------------

To get the latest version of the re-motion source code, check it out from the 
SVN server (https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/):

md c:\Remotion 
cd c:\Remotion 
svn checkout https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/ trunk 

(To obtain the SVN tool, go to http://subversion.tigris.org/. You can also use 
TortoiseSVN to check out the code if you want a graphical user interface.) 

Getting remotion.snk
--------------------

We cannot provide our own remotion.snk, so you need to create your own one.
For this, run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, make sure the .NET
SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Remotion
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.

Building re-motion from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Remotion.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.

To run all the tests from NUnit, make sure you have a local installation of
SQL Server 2005. You might need to create C:\Databases and 
C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit tests work.

Building re-motion with NAnt
----------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build-RemotionLocal.cmd
from the re-motion trunk directory:

cd c:\Remotion
Build-RemotionLocal.cmd

re-motion contains a customized version of NAnt which is used for the build
in the prereq\Tools\NAnt folder.

As with the Visual Studio build, you need a local installation of 
SQL Server 2005 to run the full build. You might also need to create 
C:\Databases and C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit 
tests work.

The build scripts will create temporary files in your C:\Temp directory.

To generate documentation files for re-motion, run Build-RemotionLocalDoc.cmd.
